VRL Package - A Carepackage for the BYOB Open Source project

You are having a hard time installing everything 100% perfect for BYOB?

Well me too. So i created a automatic script that does loads of fancy stuff that helps you.
Saves you loads of time googling and even remove you from needing to know Linux.

This is a 100% Linux-only repo, I will not help Windows users.
